## Smart Wallet on Mobile

For the Coinbase Onchain Summer Buildathon we built a React Native application that communicates to a Next.js application to create/connect a Coinbase Smart Wallet, then sign messages such as SIWE or batch transactions and return to the React Native app with some state from a deeplink URL.
